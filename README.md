# markdown_presentation_files
contains the files to turn a markdown presentation into a reveal.js html presentation

reveal.js on github: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/

If you clone this repository, you play around with the presentation.md file. Then run pandoc (command is in the md file) to turn it into html. You can also make a pdf-presentation out of it.

Make sure that for your own presentation, you push all the files in this directory up to github (i.e. not just the html file).
